<br>
<b>Q1. Kathir is a software engineer working on a project that involves managing a linked list of integers. His task is to develop a program that allows the user to insert integers at the beginning of the list and then display the entire list.

Input format :<br>
The first line of input consists of an integer n, representing the item to be inserted at the beginning of the linked list.<br>
<br>

The second line of input consists of an integer (0 or 1), representing the choice to continue or stop the insertion process.<br>
<br>

Input 0 to continue inserting more integers.<br>
<br>
Input 1 to stop inserting and display the linked list.<br>
<br>
Output format :<br>
The output displays "Node inserted" each time a new integer is inserted into the linked list in a new line.<br>
<br>

After insertion, the output displays "Linked List: " followed by the integers in the linked list in insertion order.<br>
<br>

The final line of output displays "Node ended" after displaying the linked list.<br>
